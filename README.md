# Explainable-OE-Using-PCA
This GitHub repository hosts the course project for INSE 6220, focusing on Explainable Occupancy Estimation (OE) utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
 The project explores the application of PCA in reducing model complexity thereby enhancing the interpretability of occupancy estimation models, aiming to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships within the data. Through clear documentation, code samples, and visualizations, this repository provides insights into the implementation of PCA-based techniques for explainable OE.
