# Explainable-OE-Using-PCA
This GitHub repository focuses on Explainable Occupancy Estimation (OE) utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
 The project explores the application of PCA in reducing model complexity thereby enhancing the interpretability of occupancy estimation models using SHAP, aiming to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships within the data. SMOTE is used to cater for the imbalanced dataset. Through clear documentation, code samples, and visualizations, this repository provides insights into the implementation of PCA-based techniques for explainable OE.
